This game is an attempt to recreate a clicker dice game, however I didn't get far

The main asset of this game is the random dice values. I made a dice class and allowed the dice to change images for each face of a die, and also made a method to find the value for each face of the die

The 5 pink buttons at the bottom refer to the number of dice you could have. It takes 100 points for the player to recieve a second dice, 1000 for the third, and so on

I made a store class which allows the player to buy upgrades, however, I have not been able to make upgrades for the store yet

The "goal" of the game is to get 1000 points, but the real goal is to reach for the highest score

If given more time on this project, I would add store upgrades, dice value upgrades, multiplier die, and multiplier for dice matches such as one pair, two pair, etc.

also, I'm pushing, but I'm don't think github is updating
